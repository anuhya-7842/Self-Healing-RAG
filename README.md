# Self-Healing RAG

AI-powered PDF question answering system with self-healing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Users can upload PDFs, extract and index content, retrieve relevant information, and receive grounded answers using LangGraph, Google Gemini, ChromaDB, and Streamlit. The system validates generated responses and retries automatically when necessary, improving reliability and reducing unsupported answers.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit
- LangGraph
- Google Gemini
- ChromaDB
- Sentence Transformers
- PyPDF

---

## Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will open in your browser.

---

## How It Works

1. Upload a PDF document.
2. The application extracts text from the PDF.
3. The text is split into smaller chunks.
4. Embeddings are generated using Sentence Transformers.
5. Chunks are stored in ChromaDB.
6. The user asks a question.
7. Relevant chunks are retrieved.
8. Gemini generates an answer.
9. A critic validates whether the answer is supported by the retrieved context.
10. If validation fails, the workflow retries automatically.
11. If all retries fail, a fallback response is returned.
